- We live in a multi-chain world, with billions of dollars in asset value locked on more than 100 chains. Due to the inability of blockchains to communicate with each other, and the trustless nature of public blockchains, arbitrage on a particular blockchain requires all relevant assets to exist on that blockchain, and there is no traditional financial institutions that serve as agencies, so a blockchain bridge was created to deal with this problem.
- IBC is an acronym for Inter-Blockchain Communication. In its simplest form, IBC connects different blockchains together. For example, a user wants to transfer tokens to another chain via IBC. On the source chain (chain A), there is a wrapper lock contract holding the native asset, which the user wishes to transfer to the target chain (chain B). There is a wrapped token contract on chain B that allows users to mint wrapped versions of their tokens. There is also an IBC bridge contract that allows verification of blocks and operations in the source chain, and saves the last verified block proof and the block producer schedule configured for each chain it interacts with.
- IBC is a technology that allows blockchains to communicate with each other, supporting features such as cross-chain token transfers. Unlike other IBC solutions, Antelope IBC offers a very secure IBC solution that does not require any additional trusted third parties.
- As the leading DeFi platform in the EOS ecosystem, Defibox will fully support and assist the development of IBC. Defibox will embed cross-chain functions to provide users with a good cross-chain experience, allowing many tokens on different chains to move freely under the IBC scheme. The Defibox IBC function will eliminate user barriers through a friendly user interface, provide users with convenient operations, and maximize the benefits brought by IBC. We believe in and are committed to creating a better future for the EOS ecosystem.
